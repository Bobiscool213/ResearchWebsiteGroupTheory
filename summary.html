    <p1 style="font-family:Georgia">In 1974, a Hungarian architect by the name of Erno Rubik created the first Rubik’s Cube. His intention while teaching was to show his students how to model three-dimensional movements. To do this, he spent months tinkering with wooden blocks. This included glue, tape, rubber bands, and all he could find to make these two blocks stay together. After various attempts, he came up with the Rubik’s cube. This cube became extremely popular and had such an influence on pop culture that they came up with a competitive sport called speedcubing. While most people can’t solve the Rubik’s cube, we found a way to incorporate group theory into this puzzle and found a shortcut to finding its solution. With the addition of symmetry, permutation, and algebraic structures, it’ll be like solving an equation and finding an answer. When all the colors match, you’ve found your solution!</p1>
